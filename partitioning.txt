-- Care has to be taken as to work will make the partition column.
-- Once partition has been created, you can alter some definitions of the partition different from other partitions.
-- There is no hard limit on the number of partitions that a hive table can contain.
-- Querying without the partition column with increase the amount of time the query will complete compared to a non-partitioned table.
-- Prefare static partitioning to dynamic for day-to-day data ingestion
-- Pre-empt small file scenarios
