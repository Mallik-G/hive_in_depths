CLUSTERING
=======================


- Improve time of queries that include sampling and mapside joins
- Bucketing column should be one that has a high degree of unique values. A knowledge of your dataset would help.
- Bucketing is useful for fact tables
- The number of bucket should be carefully chosen. It cannot be changed once the table has been created.
- Enforce bucketing by setting hive.enforce.bucketing=true. Not necesary for hive 2.x onward.


create external table rating_pq(
	userId bigint,
	movieId bigint,
	rate float,
	ts bigint
)
clustered by (movieId) sorted by (ts) desc into 10 buckets;
stored as parquet;
