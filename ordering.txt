Sort/Distribute/Cluster/Order By
=======================================

Nothing fancy except the old and well known order by clause that returns your query result in a particular order based on the ordering column.

However the ordering behaviour changes with each variant.


ORDER BY
	Moves everything into a single reduce and applies the sorting there.
	Could be quite slow for a large dataset.
	Guarantees total ordering

	Not that hive is now lenient on using LIMIT with ORDER BY


SORTED BY 
	Sorts data per reducer.
	Guarantees per-reducer ordering

	Change number of reducer and try sorting 
	SET mapred.reduce.tasks = 2;


DISTRIBUTE BY
	The key or column that will be used to send each records to a reducer.


CLUSTER BY
	is the same as 
		DISTRIBYTE BY col_name SORT BY col_name
